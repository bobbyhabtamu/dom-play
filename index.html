    <i>Dom-Play: a nifty little website to organize your lines! With a single click, highlight (bold or otherwise) all lines for a specific actor in a play. Also
        Un-highlight (normal or otherwise) all lines from all other actors in the play.
        We can accommodate any number of actors, and any number of additional lines added to the page.
        The page can do the work without page re-loads (i.e. it is done via JavaScript and the DOM).
        The page does not use a third party API (jQuery, for example).
        HTML "hooks" may be added to the page, meaning you can edit the HTML to enable your scripts to perform properly</i>
    <h2>Rush Hour 2 by Jeff Nathanson</h2>
    <p>The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
        a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
        dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
        look to two girls in a convertible.</p>
    <div id="play">
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.</span></p>
        <p>	(The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who is driving and singing to his radio.)</p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: (singing) ...wish they all could be California... wish they all could be California girls...</span></p>
            <p>(Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it out of the SUNROOF..)</p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Did you see the way those girls drove off? I did you a favor.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: Those girls drove off because of you.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: All I did was invite them for a drink.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.</span></p>
        <p>(Carter checks his Chinese-English dictionary)</p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: I said that?  Which word was "goat?"</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: Mu-shu?  You're hungry?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!</span></p>
